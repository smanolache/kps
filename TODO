Currently TODOs: (except as TODO marked issues in the code)

IMPORTANT:

 * related to new PolicyKit/ConsoleKit/HAL combination and 'Session'-handling:
   - fix scheme handling (don't set scheme if inactive, force correct scheme if
     active session again)
   - the running KPowersave instance can may not react as configured on empty/
     low battery if the session is inactive. May only a shutdown via KDE is
     possible. 
     Think about this possible solutions: 
     - fall back to shutdown via KDE on lowest battery level 
     - drop org.freedesktop.Policy.Power interface and let powersaved to the
       job

NORMAL:

 * fix suspend workflow, including:
   - handle errors (50 % done)

 * add code to react if KPowersave could not claim the 
   org.freedesktop.Policy.Power interface from D-Bus

 * update doxygen files, remove/update tasks etc.

 * testing and bugfixing (always!)
 
 * check if there is room of improvment for:
   - reduce calls and set/force settings (partly done)
