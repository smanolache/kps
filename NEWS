New: KPowersave 0.7.3 
=================================================

Note: The last release is now 4 months ago, so the NEWS are longer than
      normal. For all changes read the Changelog.

Major changes since the last version/release:
 - added new dialog to show logfiles if a suspend/resume fail and allow 
   the user to save the log (need to get enabled per distro)
 - added support to handle brightness key events if the machine not already 
   handle this in the hardware directly
 - added new feature named autodimm to reduce the brightness of the display 
   if the user is inactive and dimm up if the user get active again
 - new dialog shown up 30 seconds before autosuspend call the suspend to 
   warn the user and allow chancel the suspend 
 - added code to work with new PolicyKit/ConsoleKit/HAL combi to check if 
   the user is privileged (for HAL >= 0.5.10 and related PolicyKit versions)
 - added code to check if the current desktop session is avtive and handle
   if the session get inactive (via ConsoleKit)
 - added code to release/aquire org.freedesktop.Policy.Power if the session 
   get inactive/active to allow powersaved or other active KPowersave 
   instances to handle powermanagement
 - prepared KPowersave to work also with HAL >= 0.5.10 (handle renamed 
   policy names in HAL)
 - use now kdebug functions instead of own macros, added --dbg-trace option 
   to allow trace function entry and leave points.

Minor changes:
 - added wodim to autosuspend blacklist
 - changed logic for resume if a timeout happen
 - change default timeout to fake keyevent for locked screen to 2.5 sec
 - don't fake key event after locked screen and lidopen if config variable 
   timeToFakeKeyAfterLock < 0
 - added new config variable (callSetPowerSaveOnAC in [General] section) 
   to disable call SetPowerSave() on HAL.
 - fix code to guess if a 6-hour-timeout occours while suspend/resume or 
   if there was really a error 
 - removed Portuguese version of the help, since only one paragraph was 
   translated
 - fixed configure script to detect if we should use HAL to get information 
   about policies instead of PolicyKit
 - force update detailed dialog on AC events to get always e.g. the 
   correct scheme info in the dialog
 - reworked code for mouse wheel events to reuse code for brightness keys
 - several HAL/D-Bus/PolicyKit/ConsoleKit related fixes/updates
 - cleanup code, fixed compiler warnings, added new functions to removed 
   doubled code

Bugfixes:
 - fixed problems with usage of enum cpufreq_type: don't assign integer 
   values to a enum (lead to segfault since enum is a 8bit char object)
 - fixed wrong unit for power consumption (removed 'h' from unit)
 - only suspend on button events if we resumed to avoid double suspends
 - several fixes to make signals from HAL/DBus idependent from the QT 
   eventloop due to problems with the QT3 DBus bindings
 - several patches from Mandriva (lmontel@mandriva.com) to fix problems
   with translations, format messages, speedup build and memory leaks
 - fixed detection if brightness is really supported by the system
 - call setPowerSave() always depending on AC state if a scheme get set. 
 - use float for internal calculation of battery values
 - When use DBUS_TYPE_BOOLEAN use as variable type dbus_bool_t to avoid 
   possible trouble on big endian machines

New: KPowersave 0.7.2 (development tree/unstable)
=================================================

 This version is a major step to the next KPowersave stable version.
 At first: you don't need to change the KPowersave config file manually 
 any longer - this version provide now all options for powermanagement
 in KPowersave via the updated and extended configure dialog. 

 You can find all changes since the last release in this file or in the 
 Changelog. Please test KPowersave and feel free to report bugs to the 
 powersave-devel mailinglist or for SUSE products via the Novell bugzilla.

 Because of the changes in the GUI the most translations are not 
 up-to-date. Feel free to checkout the source, update your translations
 file and send it to us.

Major changes since the last version:
 - extended configure dialog to provide this functionality:
   * schemes settings:
     - add new and delete existing (no default) schemes
     - define a CPU Frequency policy for each scheme
   * general settings:
     - define battery warning levels and actions if a level reached
       as e.g. Suspend to disk, Shutdown or change the brightness
     - configure actions for button events (Power/Lid/Suspend/Sleep)
     - define the default AC and battery schemes
 - show the power consumtion of the battery in the detailed info dialog
 - umount external media before suspend (need a patch of the KDE media 
   manager) to avoid data loss and remount on resume
 - reset the CPU Freq settings on resume to avoid different settings for
   the CPU governor on multicore machines
 - call now SetCPUFreqConsiderNice(), SetCPUFreqPerformance() on dynamic
   CPU Freq policy (as poweruser setting only changeable via config file),
   and also SetPowerSave() with true on battery and false otherwise.
 - support also conservative governor as DYNAMIC fallback
 - fixed brightness handling in the configure dialog if not activated
 - removed accelerator tags from i18n() strings. KDE handle this by itself.
   Improved config GUI to be better accessible via keyboard.
 - code and code documentation cleanups and updates

Fixed bugs (from bugzilla.novell.com if no other comment):
 - #245081: KPowersave does not set (ondemand) governor on startup
 - #244052: Close lid of a laptop and suspend to ram cause 100% CPU
 - #229960: CPUFREQ_DYNAMIC_PERFORMANCE seems to be ignored during
	    boot and scheme change
 - #230686: KPowersave need to be restarted to apply DPMS settings
 - #230965: puzzling battery state info
 - #231709: kpowersave-0.7.1-12: comparison with string literal
 - #231184: KPowersave crashes due to uninitalized LibHalContext
 - #229234: KPowersave does not fall back to userspace governor
 - #215262: Suspend to disk with attached usb storage not working
 - #223164: After suspend, second core has performance governor set
 - #223517: Powersave: CPU scheme "dynamic" reduces speed if only
	    nice -19 processes run
 - #223637: kpowersave crashes in first login
 - #225212: KPowersave crash on ThinkPad X60s
 - #221715: Functionality for configuring lid close event etc.
	    missing in KPowersave
 - #223922: System not shuting down on pressing power button

KPowersave 0.7.1 (development tree/unstable)
=================================================

 I'm glad to announce the first new offical release from the KPowersave
 development version 0.7.1. This is the first version of KPowersave without
 dependency to the powersave daemon. From now KPowersave use directly the
 HAL daemon to get Hardware information and set e.g. brightness or trigger
 Suspend.

 Also if KPowersave depend no longer on powersave, I would recommend to use
 the new/current powersave version furthermore. You can use the powersave 
 daemon if there is no client as e.g. KPowersave to handle system power-
 management. If KPowersave (there is also a patch for g-p-m available) start 
 up the daemon stop automatically to handle powermanagement policy and 
 the KPowersave applet force (if allowed) the user specific policy.

 You can find all changes since the last stable release in this file or in
 the Changelog. Please test KPowersave and feel free to report bugs to 
 the powersave-devel mailinglist or for SUSE products via the Novell bugzilla. 

Major changes since the last version:
- Initial port from powersave to HAL/D-Bus/PolicyKit:
  - replaced most features from the last stable version base on powersave
    with new code. (Only missing atm eyecandy stuff as suspend progress dialog)
  - replaced code to get hardware information from powersave with get info
    from the HAL daemon
  - changed resume from suspend/standby detection and handling of the event
  - KPowersave claim now org.freedesktop.Policy.Power interface from D-Bus
    to stop powersave from handle powermanagement policy and to prevent 
    handle other clients to start powermanagement. 
  - Extended existing schemes to be complete handled in KPowersave instead
    of the powersave daemon. Added new (scheme) settings for:
    * battery warning levels
    * actions for battery warning levels and for lidclose events (as e.g. 
      SHUTDOWN, SUSPEND2DISK, SUSPEND2RAM, CPUFREQ_POWERSAVE, CPUFREQ_DYNAMIC, 
      or BRIGHTNESS)
    * AC and Battery default schemes
    * CPU Frequency Policies per scheme
      --> NOTE: you can change this settings currently only via the config file 
      		and not via the GUI configure dialog. This is the next step, we
 	      	concentrated on get KPowersave running for this release.
  - Fixed KDE screensaver and DPMS handling to reduce/avoid interfer with the
    KDE user settings. There is a KDE patch available to check if KPowersave 
    handle DPMS settings already and call the KPowersave config dialog.
